### &lt;marquee>👶🏻 My terrible, horrible, no good, very bad first website, circa 2001. 👶🏻 &lt;/marquee>

---

My very first HTML masterpiece, made safe for the modern web at [https://jarv.is/y2k/](https://jarv.is/y2k/).

For the original, untouched site straight from the dusty floppy disk, visit the [`original` branch](https://github.com/jakejarvis/y2k/tree/original) — but be warned, there are landmines full of random executables, Java applets, and Macromedia Flash embeds abound.

Uploaded for [awesome-first-code](https://github.com/jakejarvis/awesome-first-code)... You should do the same!
